jSnake v1.0
======

A hobbie project to create a jQuery snake plugin.

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/fznwebdesign/jSnake/wiki) for implementation instructions and tips, just to make sure you are leveraging all the game's features.

## Controls

In order to control your Snake, you need to click on the board to start catching the keyboard events.

The movement of your snake is controlled by the arroy keys.

## Rules

The rules of the game are very simple:

1. If you hit a wall (if enabled), another snake or yourself, your snake dies, so, avoid crashing!
2. If you eat a fruit, you gain 10 points (customizable) and your snake grows 2 spaces.
3. If you beat another snake by making them collide with your body (except for your head), you gain 100 points (also customizable).

## Enemies

You can also add some enemies to the game to make things interesting.

There are 2 types of NPC enemy snakes:

**Regular Enemies**: Will compete with you for those fruits.
**Killer Enemies**: Will compete with you for those fruits, but also try to kill you if you get close to them.

## Score Board

There is also a Score Board included on the plugin (not enabled by default), here you can track who's winning the match.

## CSS Customization

All the items on the game are CSS-styled; you will find that the default styling are basic and plain, well... the idea is that everybody can easily customize their own games, so feel free to play with the CSS.


Enjoy!
